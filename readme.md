# Begin Data

[ ![Codeship Status for smallwins/begin-data](https://app.codeship.com/projects/54207a80-9b6b-0136-cc78-3a6df96c6020/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/305743)

Begin Data is a durable and fast key/value store built on top of DynamoDB with only three core API methods: `get`, `set` and `destroy`.

## Concepts

Begin Data organizes itself into tables. Tables contain documents which are just collections of plain `Object`s. documents stored in Begin Data always have the properties `table` and `key`. Optionally an document can also have a `ttl` property with a UNIX epoch value representing the expiry time for the document.

## Usage

Begin Data operates on one DynamoDB table named `data` with a partition key `scopeID` and a sort key of `dataID` and, optionally, a `ttl` for expiring documents. 

Example `.arc`:

```
@app
myapp

@tables
data
  scopeID *String
  dataID **String
  ttl TTL
```

Or equiv CloudFormation YAML:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Resources:
    BeginData:
        Type: "AWS::DynamoDB::Table"
        Properties:
            TableName: "data"
            BillingMode: "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
            KeySchema: 
              - 
                AttributeName: "scopeID"
                KeyType: "HASH"
              - 
                AttributeName: "dataID"
                KeyType: "RANGE"
            SSESpecification: 
                Enabled: "false"
            TimeToLiveSpecification:
                AttributeName: "ttl"
                Enabled: "TRUE"
```

> Note üëâüèΩ non [Architect](https://arc.codes) projects will need `BEGIN_DATA_TABLE_NAME` environment variable. You can also use this env var to override and name the table anything you want. This also allows for mulitple apps to share a single table.
 
### API

```javascript
let data = require('@begin/data')
```

The core API is three methods:

- `data.get(params, [callback]) ‚Üí Promise` for retreiving data
- `data.set(params, [callback]) ‚Üí Promise` for writing data 
- `data.destroy(params, [callback]) ‚Üí Promise` for removing data

Additional helper methods are also made available:

- `data.incr(params, [callback]) ‚Üí Promise` increment an attribute on an document
- `data.decr(params, [callback]) ‚Üí Promise` decrement an attribute on an document
- `data.count(params, [callback]) ‚Üí Promise` get the number of documents for a given table

All methods accept params object and, optionally, a Node style errback. If no errback is supplied a promise is returned. All methods support `async`/`await`.

#### Writes

Save an document in a table by key. Remember `table` is always required.

```javascript
let taco = await data.set({
  table: 'tacos', 
  key: 'al-pastor'
})
```

`key` is optional. But all documents have a key. If no key is given `set` will generate a unique `key`. 

```javascript
let token = await data.set({
  table: 'tokens', 
})
// {table:'tokens', key:'s89sdfjskfdj'}
```

Batch save multiple documents at once by passing an array of objects.

```javascript
let collection = await data.set([
  {table: 'ppl', name:'brian', email:'b@brian.io'},
  {table: 'ppl', name:'sutr0', email:'sutr0@brian.io'},
  {table: 'tacos', key:'pollo'},
  {table: 'tacos', key:'carnitas'},
])
```

#### Reads

Read an document by key:

```javascript
let yum = await data.get({
  table: 'tacos', 
  key: 'baja'
})
```

Batch read by passing an array of objects. With these building blocks you can construct secondary indexes and joins like one-to-many and many-to-many.

```javascript
await data.get([
  {table:'tacos', key:'carnitas'},
  {table:'tacos', key:'al-pastor'},
])
```

#### Destroy

Delete an document by key.

```javascript
await data.destroy({
  table: 'tacos', 
  key: 'pollo'
})
```

Batch delete documents by passing an array of objects.

```javascript
await data.destroy([
  {table:'tacos', key:'carnitas'},
  {table:'tacos', key:'al-pastor'},
])
```

## Additional Superpowers

- Documents can be expired by setting `ttl` to an UNIX epoch in the future.
- Atomic counters: `data.incr` and `data.decr`
